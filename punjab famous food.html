	<p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px; margin-left: 600px;"><b>1.LASSI</b></span></p>
      <div class="sa">
         <img src="pics\ls.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>A drink known far and wide, lassi is something Punjabi's pride themselves in. Though it can be salty, the original lassi as it became famous, is sweet with a dollop of cream and butter to make it as rich as you can. Flavours like mango rose or strawberry are added these days to give it a twist while beating the summer heat. Almost all restaurants serve this even if they're not Punjabi joints which show the popularity of this humble drink.</p>
      <p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px; margin-left: 600px;"><b>2.CHOLE BHATURE</b></span></p>
      <div class="sa">
         <img src="pics\cbp.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>It's a standard Punjabi dish in most fast-food restaurants now. And these two accompany each other like a dream when you feel like indulging a little. Made with flour and milk rather than wheat flour, it's different from a poori. And although it's much larger than a poori, you can't just eat one because it's that tasty! The soft, slightly fermented bhatura should be your Go-to when you are craving some hardcore, spicy food of Punjab.</p>
      <p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px; margin-left: 600px;"><b>3.AMRITSARI FISH</b></span></p>
      <div class="sa">
         <img src="pics\af.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>An amazing contribution of the food of Punjab to the rest of India, Amritsari fish is a favourite dish among non-vegetarians of India! A succulent, fried fish, this can be had either with naan or just like that since it is a dry dish. Batter-fried, it is juicy and succulent on the inside while also being spicy. It is served in places all over the country with the same name which is only a testament to its popularity. A spicy fish with cold lassi, you possibly cannot go wrong with the combination!</p>
      <p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px; margin-left: 600px;"><b>4.DAL MAKHNI</b></span></p>
      <div class="sa">
         <img src="pics\dm.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>If one dal had to rule them all, it would definitely be the dal makhani. This delectable buttery Punjabi dish of lentils is a rich concoction of black lentils and red kidney beans made in a thick gravy made even richer with dollops of cream. It's a dish worth serving in a royal court. Traditionally, it simmers for 2-3 hours over a low flame to get it to thicken as the flavours keep becoming deeper.</p>
      <p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px; margin-left: 600px;"><b>5.PANEER PAKODA</b></span></p>
      <div class="sa">
         <img src="pics\ppp.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>Also called 'chicken of the vegetarians', the paneer tikka has a special place in the food of Punjab. Chargrilled and spiced, this soft cottage cheese delicacy is the first to come to mind when one thinks of vegetarian appetisers. And frankly, any menu would be incomplete without it!</p>
      <p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px; margin-left: 600px;"><b>6.RAJMA CHAWAL</b></span></p>
      <div class="sa">
         <img src="pics\rc.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>It's a staple in every household in north India while also having a nostalgic connotation for most. Having rajma or chawal with anything apart from each other feels wrong, like breaking up your favourite couple. Even though it comes from Kashmir indigenously, it's a favourite among all Punjabis and their grandmothers. This Punjabi dish is also generally served with a side of pickled onions, to enhance the taste. To give it a slight twist, some people also add a little bit of crushed papad to their rajma chawal to give it a nice crunch.</p>
      <p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px; margin-left: 600px;"><b>7.SARSON KA SAAG</b></span></p>
      <div class="sa">
         <img src="pics\sks.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>'Sarson ka khet' is synonymous with Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, given that food and Bollywood our two, true Indian passions. Every north Indian foodie worth their salt (and spices) would associate this dish with Punjabi cuisine. Being a winter favourite, it can be found in all restaurants as a speciality. Given the slightly bitter taste of the mustard leaves, spinach can also be added to make it healthier, tastier and with a dollop of the famous dest-ghee for good measure and as a wintery guilty pleasure!</p>
       <p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px; margin-left: 600px;"><b>8.MAKKE KI ROTI</b></span></p>

      <div class="sa">
         <img src="pics\kp.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>If there's anything else a gurudwara is famous for apart from tranquillity, kindness and their open kitchens, it is the karma Prashad. This dish of the food of Punjab is one of the best things which you've ever tasted, especially on a cold morning in a Gurudwara. Made with equal portions of sooji or semolina, butter and sugar, it is a dish that screams love and affection, much like your mother does. The Golden Temple is the most famous for this, it is served up in all other gurdwaras as well as made in Punjabi households on special occasions. If you want to show someone you love them, make them a smattering of this indulgent halwa, a true labour of love!</p>
      <p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px; margin-left: 600px;"><b>10.GOBHI SALJAM GAJJAR AACHAR</b></span></p>
      <div class="sa">
         <img src="pics\gsa.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>Indians love all things spicy, especially their pickles. And chances are, growing up in north India, you would have seen your grandmother prepare some every winter. Punjab's love for pickles is a notch higher than the rest of the country. To go with the buttery food of Punjab, tangy pickles are the best way to cleanse your palate. One of the most famous is cauliflower-turnip-carrot pickle. It's tangy, sweet and spicy or most flavours we like in our food in a single accompaniment!</p>
