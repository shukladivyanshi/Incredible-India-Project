   <p>The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort Complex. The private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement. The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Fort’s innovative planning and architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings and gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.

This palace fortress is known as the Red Fort because of the red sandstone fabric of its rampart walls. The fort with its halls, palaces, pavilions and serene gardens was completed in 1648. Within the enclosure of the red fort are located many fairytale buildings. The Diwan-i-Khas (also known as Shah Mahal) and the Rang Mahal (also called Imtiyaz Mahal or palace of distinctions) are the two most conspicuous buildings inside the Red Fort. The Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i- Aam) is another famous building within the Red Fort. Son-et-lumiere shows, tracing the history of the Mughal Empire in India, outlining their glory and the eventful causes for their downfall are held in the Red Fort every evening.

      <p>A stunning archway standing as a tribute to the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country, India Gate is one of the landmarks of Delhi. Built with sandstone, this 42-m-high gate was the first of its kind in the national capital. The walls of the gateway have been inscribed with the names of 13,516 soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919, besides 90,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who were martyred in World War I. The base of the monument is made of red Bharatpur stones and the structure of India Gate is similar to France's Arc- de- Triomphe.</p><br><br>

      <p>Rashtrapati Bhavan, built as the British Viceroy’s residence, is now home to the President of the world’s largest democracy. It is emblematic of Indian democracy and its secular, plural and inclusive traditions. Located in an area of 130 hectar, the building is the highlight of Lutyen’s New Delhi and was completed in 1929 with the palace having 340 rooms. The most magnificent room in the Rashtrapati Bhavan is the Durbar Hall, which is the ceremonial hall for all official functions of the President of India. The “Changing of the Guard” ceremony can be viewed from the gates of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, (schedule can be referred from https://presidentofindia.gov.in) .

Near the Qutub Minar lies Quwwat-ul-Islam, considered to be India's oldest mosque, built in 1199. Visitors will also find an Iron Pillar, dating back to the 4th century AD. It is said that if you can encircle it with your arms while standing with your back to it your wish will be fulfilled.</p><br><br>
