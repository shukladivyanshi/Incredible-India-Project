	<p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px; margin-left: 530px;"><b>Culture & Heritage Of Delhi</b></span></p>
	<p>Delhi is one of the high-power ancient regions, which has regained and improved cultural beauty throughout history with different empires controlling it. Delhi has a chaotic asymmetric beauty. One side of Delhi is still with the ancient style architecture, old winding lanes, age-old markets, and traditional communities. This Old Delhi is still holding its traditional values whereas New Delhi is getting flourished with modernization. This diversity in culture makes Delhi, a most prominent tourist attraction.</p>
	<p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px;"><b>LANGUAGE:</b></span></p>
	<p>More than 80% of the Delhi population speaks Hindi. The remaining population prefers Punjabi, Bengali, Urdu, and others. Just like any other region of India, English is the most common foreign language preferred. Contrary to common belief, Hindi is not the national language of the land, but it is one of the official languages.

Hindi is not just one language. It is a colloquial amalgamation of numerous other languages of northern India. Hindi is a combination of Sanskrit, Urdu and other local languages. The vernacular Hindu took a stance during the reign of Mughals. However, the Hindi of Mughal reign is much different than the modern language as it got more vocabulary terms from Persian and other Hindustani regions. You can also find many words from Arabic vocabulary in Hindi.</p>
<p class="ab"><span style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 0px;"><b>RELIGION:</b></span></p>
<p>In the past, Hinduism was one of the prime religions of this region. However, during the 12th century and later, the invaders from mid-western and mid-eastern countries started to invade India. Turkey, Persia and other country invaders tried to capture Delhi as it was the symbol of power during ancient times. Many religions managed to capture Delhi too. Qutub Minar was the first Islamic structure along with a mosque. The main aim of the mosque was to show the invasion of Islamic reign into India.

Since then, Islam has been another major ethnicity along with Hinduism. In terms of population, Hinduism ranks first followed by Islam, Sikhism and then Christianity. No matter how many religious communities are present in Delhi, there is harmony among this diversity. Temples, mosques, churches, and Gurudwara stand side by side and stay as one single community; Delhiites (colloquial term for people of Delhi).</p>
